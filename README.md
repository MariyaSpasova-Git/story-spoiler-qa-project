# Manual QA Project (Story Spoiler)

> Comprehensive manual QA testing of the Story Spoiler web application — 106 test cases executed, 9 bugs and 22 queries logged. Full documentation includes detailed test cases, bug reports, and query tracking.

## Project Overview

This repository contains all the Quality Assurance artifacts for the "Story Spoiler" web application, a platform designed for registered users to create, manage, and share short, story-based content. The project was completed as part of the QA Fundamentals and Manual Testing course at Software University and serves as a professional portfolio piece, showcasing an end-to-end QA workflow from requirements analysis and test case design through to bug logging, management, and final reporting.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this QA initiative is to ensure the Story Spoiler application functions exactly as expected, according to the provided six core use cases. This involves:

- Developing a complete set of Test Cases for each use case.

- Executing all Test Cases to confirm or deny expected functionality.

- Detecting and documenting all identified bugs in detail.

- Maintaining traceability between requirements (Use Cases), testing (Test Cases), and defects (Bug Reports).

## Key Findings

This section will be populated upon the completion of the testing cycle. It will reference the final qa-report.md and summarize the overall quality status of the Story Spoiler application, including:

- **Total Test Cases Executed:** 106.
- **Total Bugs Logged:** 9.
- **Total Queries Logged:** 22.
- **Major functional or systemic issues identified**.
